# maze-generator

Experimenting with Disjoin Sets (Union Find) for maze generation.

## WARNING

This is just a play test, and the code need to be clean (code clean, tests, documentations, ...).

Moreover, the generated mazes are ugly. The maze entry point is the top left cell, and the exit point is the bottom right cell.
All cells and walls are randomly choose, so the probability that it will select on of those cells is low. This is why generated mazes had few walls.
